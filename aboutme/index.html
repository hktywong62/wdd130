    <p>Let me introduce myself.  I'm married to my wonderful wife and have 3 wonderful children.  This is my first webpage I have ever written.  I am really excited to join this class.</p>
    <p>I completed my BYU PathwayConnect two weeks ago.  I am grateful for this program as it is inexpensive and helps me further my education.</p>
    <p>I hope I can learn writing webpages for my family members.  Looking forward to having a great semester with all of you. </p>
