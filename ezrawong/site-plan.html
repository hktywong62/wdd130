        It is my pleasure to present my son Ezra in this website. I would like all of you to know him more so that 
        you can better consider his applications for enrollment to your prestigious schools.  Ezra is an all-rounded student
        with potential that deserves your due considerations for enrolment.

      <h3>Family Background and Kindergarten</h3>
      <p>
        Ezra was born in a family of modest means, being the youngest one.  His older brother and his sister are 12 years and 10 years his senior respectively. His birth was a surprise to his parents.  His father is an accountant in an insurance brokerage firm and his mom is a school assistant in a primary school.  
        Both of his siblings are now attending universities in USA.
        He was weighed nine pounds when his mom gave birth to him.  He was considered a big-sized baby by the hospital.

        He was very healthy in his pre-school years.  After 3 years old, he was sent to a nearby kindergarten ran by a charity group.  He was very popular there as many kids called him by his nice nickname, ChingChing, the double sounds of his last given name and always had fun with them.  He enhanced his self-care ability a lot,
        like tidying his bed after nap every afternoon during this period of time.   On the other hand, he became more proactive in the class.   This trait of proactiveness has been following him to his current primary school life.

      </ul>
      <h3>Primary School</h3>
      <p>
        Ezra enrolled into S.K.H Yap Laap Memorial Primary School through the balloting system in September 2018.  As the CO-VID 18 broke out in late 2019, he had to attend classes on zoom from the spring of 2020 until this March.   Like some of the kids who had to stayed home for zoom lessons,
         he gained a lot of weight due to due to overeat and lack workouts.
         After he realized his weight problem, he has already lost over 10 pounds by eating less but doing more physical exercises.  Although he remains overweight for over 10 pounds, it will be all right after going into adolescent age.
        His mathematics scores always stand in the first quartile of the whole grade.    Overall speaking, 
        he always ranks between the bottom of the first band and the upper of the second band of the whole grade.   I am confident that he can do better whenever he feels he has to.    Also, as parents, as long as he can have above average academic results, I do not want him to become a bookworm.  

        In this May, Ezra was called to serve as a student guide on the open day of the 25th anniversary of his school.  Many guests and parents of students visited the campus on that day.  His class teacher told us that he proactively presented the materials to them.  Unlike other fellow guides, he did not feel shy but calm to talk to them.
        He has been learning piano and percussion since he was 6 years old.  He plays once a month for the sacrament meeting like his siblings.  He also joined a percussion performance in the central library organized by a government department a few months ago.
        Besides, he started learning swimming at 5 years old and eventually joined the school swimming this April.  Joining the school team to play for school is always his wish.   He took part the swimming competition of the school district and won a bronze medal in the free style of 100 meter long.  This is a big surprise to all of us.
