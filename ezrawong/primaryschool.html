            <p>Ezra enrolled into S.K.H Yap Laap Memorial Primary School through the balloting system in September 2018.  As the CO-VID 18 broke out in late 2019, he had to attend classes on zoom from the spring of 2020 until this March. 
                  Like some of the kids who had to stayed home for zoom lessons, he gained a lot of weight due to overeat and lack workouts.  After he realized his weight problem, he has already lost over 10 pounds by eating less and doing more physical exercises.
                  Although he remains overweight for over 10 pounds, it will be all right after going into adolescent age.

            <p>In this May, Ezra was called to serve as a student guide on the open day of the 25th anniversary of his school.  Many guests and parents of students visited the campus on that day. 
                 Instead of being nervous, he was very calm to introduce the visitors the display of his school.
                 In 2018, he started learning piano and percussion.  Currently, he plays once a month in the sacrament meeting of our ward.
                He also joined a percussion performance in the central library organized by a government department a few months ago.
                On the other hand, he started learning swimming at 5 years old and eventually joined the school swimming team this April.  Joining the school team to play for school is always his wish. 
                He took part in the swimming competition of the school district and won a bronze medal in the free style of 100 meter long beyond our expectation.
