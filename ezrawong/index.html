            <p>Ezra was born in a family of modest means, being the youngest one.  His older brother and his sister are 12 years and 10 years his senior respectively. His birth was a surprise to his parents.  His father is an accountant in an insurance brokerage firm and his mom is a school assistant in a primary school.  Both of his siblings are now attending universities in USA.
                He was weighed nine pounds when his mom gave birth to him.  He was considered a big-sized baby by the hospital.
